        <h2>Description</h2>
        Tofu-Cauliflower-Ginger-Yogurt is a vegetarian dish. I learned this recipe when I was in Taiwan.
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>cauliflower, cut into 1-inch florets</li>
            <li>firm tofu, cut into cube of 3/4-inch sides </li>
            <li>yogurt</li>
            <li>ginger, chopped finely</li>
            <li>onion, sliced about 1/3-inch thick </li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>black pepper</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>coriander leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>cauliflower florets with olive oil and salt</li>
            <li>roast cauliflower in oven (475 degree Fahrenheit) for about 20 minutes</li>
            <li>after cauliflower are done, roast tofu in the same way (personally, I prefer to saute tofu in oil over medium heat for about 10 minutes)</li>
            <li>put onion slices in a bowl and season with salt; set aside for 10-15 minutes, and drain any liquid afterwards</li>
            <li>mix yogurt and finely chopped ginger in a bowl and season with black pepper and salt</li>
            <li>put cauliflower, tofu, and onion in a plate and sprinkle coriander leaves; serve with ginger-yogurt</li>
        </ol>
